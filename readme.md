# FPGA toys

Some little FPGA projects I worked on.

They date back to 2018.

So far every one of them is based on the Cyclone IV development board.
I didn't get to use the V yet, but well, stuff like this happens when
you get excited about new things.  Now I kind of regret having bought
them... I would've preferred some open source alternative.
